Hi.
This is official implementation of Stack in C.
As I have been looking for a conventional design pattern in C, I wrote this piece of code for test.
The most important point in this code is the implementation of "Encapsulation" in C. Although it's quite different with OO languages but it already implements information hiding, security, Flexibility as well as abstract data type(ADT) for having multiple stacks in a single program.
